# Stimulus Testing

Stimulus is a JavaScript framework with modest ambitions. I'm playing around with it here to manipulate the DOM by using JavaScript controllers. The features I made here to practice with Stimulus: toggle display upon event, toggle styles upon event, and warn user when they've typed too many characters in a text area.
